# QuantumForex: Algorithmic Forex Trading Engine in Rust

This repository contains QuantumForex, a high-performance, low-latency algorithmic trading engine designed for the Forex market, built from the ground up in Rust. It leverages the speed and safety of Rust to provide a robust and reliable platform for automated trading strategies.

QuantumForex aims to empower developers and traders with a toolset capable of executing complex trading algorithms with precision and efficiency. In the demanding world of Forex trading, even milliseconds can make a significant difference. By utilizing Rust's memory safety and concurrency features, QuantumForex minimizes the risk of crashes and ensures deterministic execution, crucial for consistent profitability. The engine is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing users to easily integrate custom indicators, risk management modules, and order execution strategies.

The core of QuantumForex focuses on three primary areas: market data ingestion, strategy execution, and order management. The market data module supports various data feeds, allowing users to connect to multiple brokers or data providers. The strategy execution engine provides a flexible framework for defining and testing trading algorithms, enabling backtesting and live trading simulations. The order management module handles order placement, modification, and cancellation, interfacing with broker APIs to execute trades based on the strategy's signals.

QuantumForex provides a competitive edge in the Forex market by combining speed, reliability, and flexibility. It offers a solid foundation for building sophisticated trading systems, allowing traders to automate their strategies and potentially capitalize on market inefficiencies. The engine's modular design promotes code reusability and facilitates the development of custom solutions tailored to specific trading styles and risk profiles.

## Key Features

*   **High-Performance Market Data Ingestion:** Uses asynchronous programming with Tokio to handle real-time market data feeds from multiple sources simultaneously. Supports various data formats and protocols, including FIX and REST APIs. The system is designed to minimize latency and ensure data integrity. Example: Utilizing the `tokio::select!` macro to concurrently process messages from different data streams.

*   **Pluggable Strategy Execution Engine:** Allows users to define trading algorithms using a custom domain-specific language (DSL) or by implementing Rust traits. Supports backtesting with historical data and live trading simulations. The engine incorporates a risk management module to automatically adjust position sizes based on pre-defined risk parameters. Example: Implementing the `TradingStrategy` trait and defining the `on_tick` method to process incoming market data and generate trading signals.

*   **Low-Latency Order Management:** Integrates with broker APIs to execute trades with minimal delay. Supports various order types, including market orders, limit orders, and stop-loss orders. The order management module provides real-time order status updates and handles order rejections and cancellations gracefully. Example: Using the `reqwest` crate to interact with a broker's REST API for order placement and retrieval.

*   **Modular Architecture:** Designed for extensibility and code reusability. Allows users to easily integrate custom indicators, risk management modules, and order execution strategies. Components are loosely coupled, promoting maintainability and reducing the impact of changes to individual modules. Example: Defining interfaces for indicators and risk management modules to enable easy swapping of different implementations.

*   **Robust Error Handling:** Employs Rust's ownership and borrowing system to prevent memory leaks and data races. Utilizes extensive error handling and logging to ensure the system's stability and reliability. Example: Using `Result` and `Option` types extensively to handle potential errors and missing data.

*   **Backtesting Framework:** Includes a built-in backtesting framework that allows users to evaluate the performance of their trading strategies on historical data. Provides various performance metrics, such as profit factor, drawdown, and win rate. Example: Using the `serde` crate to serialize and deserialize historical market data for backtesting purposes.

*   **Configurable Risk Management:** Features a configurable risk management system that allows users to define their risk tolerance and automatically adjust position sizes accordingly. Supports various risk management techniques, such as stop-loss orders, position sizing based on volatility, and maximum drawdown limits. Example: Implementing a dynamic position sizing algorithm based on the Average True Range (ATR) indicator.

## Technology Stack

*   **Rust:** The primary programming language, providing memory safety, concurrency, and performance.
*   **Tokio:** An asynchronous runtime for building concurrent and scalable applications. Used for handling market data feeds and order execution.
*   **Reqwest:** An asynchronous HTTP client for interacting with broker APIs.
*   **Serde:** A framework for serializing and deserializing data structures. Used for backtesting and configuration management.
*   **Log:** A logging facade providing a common interface for logging messages.
*   **Chronotope:** A date and time library providing timezone support and efficient date/time calculations.

## Installation

1.  Ensure you have Rust installed. You can download and install it from [https://www.rust-lang.org/](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
2.  Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/jjfhwang/QuantumForex.git
3.  Navigate to the project directory:
    cd QuantumForex
4.  Build the project:
    cargo build --release

## Configuration

QuantumForex uses environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and define the following variables:

*   `BROKER_API_KEY`: Your broker API key.
*   `BROKER_API_SECRET`: Your broker API secret.
*   `DATA_FEED_URL`: The URL of the market data feed.
*   `LOG_LEVEL`: The logging level (e.g., `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`).

Example `.env` file:

BROKER_API_KEY=your_api_key
BROKER_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
DATA_FEED_URL=ws://example.com/market_data
LOG_LEVEL=info

## Usage

To run the trading engine, execute the following command:

cargo run --release

This will start the engine and connect to the configured market data feed and broker API.

Example Strategy (within the src folder create `strategies/my_strategy.rs`):

// Example Strategy Implementation
use quantumforex::strategy::TradingStrategy;
use quantumforex::data::MarketData;

pub struct MyStrategy {}

impl TradingStrategy for MyStrategy {
    fn on_tick(&self, market_data: &MarketData) -> Option<quantumforex::order::Order> {
        // Your trading logic here. This is a placeholder.
        None
    }
}
